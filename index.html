            <h3>What does stewardship mean to you?</h3>
            <p>To me, stewardship means being a careful and responsible guardian of the resources that have been entrusted to me. This encompasses financial, material, environmental, and relational resources. It involves recognizing that I am not the absolute owner of everything I have, but rather I have the responsibility to use these resources wisely, preserve them for future generations, and share them with those who have less.</p>

        <div class="response-section">
            <h3>How have you applied (or seen others apply) the concept of stewardship in your life?</h3>
            <p>In my personal life, I apply the concept of stewardship through conscious management of my finances, avoiding waste, and practicing sustainability in my daily decisions. In my company, we implement policies to reduce our environmental impact, such as minimizing paper use and adopting digital solutions.</p>
            
            <p>I have seen inspiring examples of stewardship in my community, such as community recycling programs led by neighbors and local businesses that donate a percentage of their profits to charitable causes. My grandfather was also a great example, as he always meticulously cared for his tools and belongings, repairing them instead of replacing them, and generously sharing his knowledge and resources with those around him.</p>
